# IPFLow

IPFlow is a project integrating Machine Learning, Cybersecurity, and Networking. Its goal is to provide an IDS/IPS that monitors network traffic, detecting significant spikes or changes to identify potential attacks and vulnerabilities.

It is aimed to build a simple automatic packet capture and analysis workflow with the use of ML to analyse the poackets being recieved and the network flow metrics in order to detect a possible attack or unusual activity in a network, this will be done by analysing the following metrics:


## Packet capture

## Machine learning
